# This file contains all the messages of the plugin. It is important to NOT
# remove or add any argument declarations (%s) from as string because this
# will cause issues when the message needs to be displayed. You are however
# free to move the argument declarations around in a string, as long as the
# amount of them stays the same. A string can accept color codes if indicated
# with a '&' character.
